# VERILOG_PRACTICE
Verilog is a hardware description language used to model and design digital systems. It allows engineers to describe the behavior and structure of electronic systems, such as integrated circuits and FPGA-based designs. Verilog is widely used in digital design, verification, and synthesis processes for creating hardware models, simulations, and testbenches. It's known for its ability to describe complex digital systems and its role in the design and verification of electronic circuits.

# Verilog Practice Lab — ModelSim Step-by-Step

Welcome! This repository is a step-by-step Verilog practice guide built for beginners and intermediate learners who want to learn by doing and simulate designs using **ModelSim**.

**Goals**
- Teach Verilog fundamentals with small, focused exercises.
- Show exact steps to run, simulate, and debug each design in ModelSim.
- Provide a daily practice plan so you can progress steadily.
